# Simulation Parameters

The [`parameters`](./../parameters) directory contains files specifying parameters for various aspects of the molecular dynamics simulations.
These files are used by the [`scripts`](./../scripts) to generate the inputs for the Plumed-patched Gromacs simulations.

[`mdp`](./mdp) contains the molecular dynamics parameters (MDP) for Gromacs.
File specifications are described in the [Gromacs manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/mdp-options.html).
The file names are important, as they are used by the [`scripts`](./../scripts) to call `gmx grompp` on the `mdp` files to generate the input `tpr` files for the simulations.
The files are placed in subdirectories according to the type of simulation they are used for.

[`packmol`](./packmol) contains the input files for the [Packmol](http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml) program.
The `inp` files are used to generate the initial configurations for the simulations from `pdb` files found in the [`initial-structure`](./../initial-structure) directory.
Packmol documentation contains a broad variety of [example inputs](http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/examples.shtml).

[`plumed-mdrun`](./plumed-mdrun) contains the input files for the [Plumed](https://www.plumed.org/) patch inside `gmx mdrun`.
These files should be called during a simulation with the `-plumed` flag.
We currently have template input files for HREMD and metadynamics simulations.

[`shell`](./shell) contains the input files for the [`scripts`](./../scripts) to generate the input files for the entire simulation pipeline that we have developed.
Inside each file is several Bash global variables that are used to specify the parameters for the simulation pipeline.
This is the directory that users will interact with the most frequently to study a broad range of systems.
Simply create a new file in this directory and call the [`run`](./../scripts/run) script with the `--global-var` flag to run the entire simulation pipeline for that system.
