# This is a Spack environment file.
#
# We have chosen versions closest to the ones used in the repository
# project, but spack does not have all versions on the packages
# we use. Results should be reproducible with other versions.
#
# NOTE: We patch `share/top/residuetypes.dat` directory for our custom
# residue names on acrylic acid. This is not included in the spack
# environment file and must be modified manually.

# Used for env "md"
