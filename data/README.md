# Simulation Data

The [`data`](./../data) directory contains data files that are produced by the simulations.
These files are not tracked by Git, as they are large and change frequently.
The files inside this directory follow a strict tree structure, which is described by the MD scripts in the [`scripts`](./../scripts) directory.
